👋 Hi, I'm @a-pastore, a master's student studying Applied Research in Engineering Studies at Nuremberg Tech. I'm also a technical consultant and software developer at Siemens, working on mobile autonomous robots, industrial software platforms and linux-based Hardware.

👀 I'm interested in swarm robotics, multi-agent architecture, robot localization, and navigation.

🌱 I'm currently learning advanced techniques for swarm robotics and exploring the latest developments in multi-robot systems and localization algorithms.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to swarm robotics, multi-agent systems, and robotics research with a ❤️ for ROS 2.
